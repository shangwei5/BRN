## Bilateral Recursive Network for Single Image Deraining（ICASSP  2020）
[[pdf](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9053081)
### Introduction
We in this paper propose a bilateral recurrent network (**BRN**) to simultaneously exploit the rain streak layer and the clean background image. 
Generally, we employ dual residual networks (**ResNet**) that are recursively unfolded to sequentially extract the rain streak layer (**Fr**) and predict the clean background image (**Fx**). 
In particular, we further propose bilateral LSTMs (**BLSTM**), which not only can respectively propagate deep features of the rain streak layer and the background image acorss stages, but also bring reciprocal communications between (**Fr**) and (**Fx**). 
The experimental results demonstrate that our BRN notably outperforms state-of-the-art deep deraining networks on synthetic datasets quantitatively and qualitatively. On real rainy images, our BRN also performs more favorably in generating visually plausible background images. 


## Prerequisites
- Python 3.6, PyTorch >= 0.4.0
- Requirements: opencv-python, tensorboardX
- Platforms: Ubuntu 16.04, cuda-8.0 & cuDNN v-5.1 (higher versions also work well)
- MATLAB for computing [evaluation metrics](statistics/)


## Datasets

BRN and its variants are evaluated on three datasets*: 
Rain100H [1], Rain100L [1] and Rain12 [2]. 
Please download the testing datasets from [BaiduYun](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1J0q6Mrno9aMCsaWZUtmbkg)
or [OneDrive](https://1drv.ms/f/s!AqLfQqtZ6GwGgep-hgjLxkov2SSZ3g), 
and place the unzipped folders into `/media/r/dataset/rain/`.

To train the models, please download training datasets: 
RainTrainH [1] and RainTrainL [1] from [BaiduYun](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1J0q6Mrno9aMCsaWZUtmbkg)
or [OneDrive](https://1drv.ms/f/s!AqLfQqtZ6GwGgep-hgjLxkov2SSZ3g), 
and place the unzipped folders into `/media/r/dataset/rain/`. 

Of course, you can also create your own folders to place datasets, but make sure it corresponds to `--data_path` in `.sh`.

*_We note that:_

_(i) The datasets in the website of [1] seem to be modified. 
    But the models and results in recent papers are all based on the previous version, 
    and thus we upload the original training and testing datasets 
    to [BaiduYun](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1J0q6Mrno9aMCsaWZUtmbkg) 
    and [OneDrive](https://1drv.ms/f/s!AqLfQqtZ6GwGgep-hgjLxkov2SSZ3g)._ 

_(ii) For RainTrainH, we strictly exclude 546 rainy images that have the same background contents with testing images.
    All our models are trained on remaining 1,254 training samples._
        

## Getting Started

### 1) Testing

We have placed our pre-trained models into `./logs/`. 

Run shell scripts to test the models:
```bash
bash test_BRN.sh   # test models about BRN
bash test_CRN.sh   # test models about CRN
bash test_BRN-XR.sh     # test models about BRN-XR
bash test_BRN-RX.sh   # test models about BRN-RX
```
All the results in the paper are also available at [BaiduYun](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1KnJBNPB6Me5V464rJJT3ig&shfl=sharepset).
You can place the downloaded results into `./result/`, and directly compute all the [evaluation metrics](statistics/) in this paper.  

### 2) Evaluation metrics

We also provide the MATLAB scripts to compute the average PSNR and SSIM values reported in the paper.
 

```Matlab
 cd ./statistic
 run statistic_Rain100H.m
 run statistic_Rain100L.m
 run statistic_Rain12.m
```
###
Average PSNR/SSIM values on four datasets:

Dataset    | BRN       |BRN-XR     |BRN-RX     |CRN  
-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------
Rain100H   |29.58/0.902|29.50/0.901|29.16/0.898|29.10/0.897
Rain100L   |37.82/0.981|37.65/0.980|37.40/0.979|37.52/0.980
Rain12     |36.70/0.959|36.63/0.959|36.54/0.959|36.58/0.959


### 3) Training

Run shell scripts to train the models:
```bash
bash train_R100H.sh      
bash train_R100L.sh   
```
You can use `tensorboard --logdir ./logs/your_model_path` to check the training procedures.
